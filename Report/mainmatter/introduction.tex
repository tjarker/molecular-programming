\section{Introduction}
This report documents the design, implementation and testing of a tool for computing on the basis of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) using the functional programming language F\#. The project is inspired by the formalization of a language for chemical reactions proposed in \textit{CRN++: Molecular Programming Language} \cite{soloveichik2018a}.
