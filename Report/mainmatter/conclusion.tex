\section{Conclusion}
With this project, we have implemented a tool for computation with the CRN++ molecular programming language using functional programming in F\#. We have formulated a revised grammar for CRN++ and a set of \textit{well-formed} properties. 
 
%We have translated the formal properties of trees into F\# predicates that can be tested using property-based testing with the \texttt{FsCheck} package. Also, we have configured \texttt{FsCheck} with classification of test cases, a custom generator and shrinker as well as automated property tests. Furthermore, using our library allows for visualization of the drawing trees as SVG files, with several customizable options. Overall, the project has provided us a great opportunity to familiarize ourselves with coding in F\# as well as the functional paradigm as a whole.
